            Hi there, my name is <span className="text-orange-400 font-bold">Luis Barcel√≥</span> and I'm a self-taught junior <span className="text-orange-400 font-bold">javascript developer</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy creating new applications as well as learning new technologies and methodologies that can help you producing <span className="text-orange-400 font-bold">neat code</span>. I have been focused on learning <span className="text-orange-400 font-bold">ReactJS</span> as well as <span className="text-orange-400 font-bold">React Native</span> lately, while trying to build at the same time a solid javascript foundation.
            </p>
          <p>
            Always have had a genuine interest in <span className="text-orange-400 font-bold">software development</span> from a young age, even during the last years, while working as an architect. I also have interest in economics, especially in the futures market, where I day trade.
