            Hi there, my name is <span className="highlight">Luis Barcel√≥</span> and I'm a <span className="highlight">Junior JavaScript Developer</span>.
          </p>
          <p>I enjoy creating new applications as well as learning new technologies and methodologies that can help you producing neat code. During my learning, I have been mostly focused on <span className="highlight">ReactJS</span> with <span className="highlight">Redux</span> in the frond end and <span className="highlight">Express</span> with <span className="highlight">Mongoose</span> in the back end, although I have also had exposure to other exciting technologies like <span className="highlight">React Native</span> or <span className="highlight">GraphQL</span>.</p>
          <p>
            Always have had a genuine interest in software development from a young age, even during the last years, while working as an Architect. I also have interest in finance, especially in the futures market, where I like to trade every now and then.
          </p>
